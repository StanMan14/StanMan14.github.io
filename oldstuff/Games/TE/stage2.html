<h1>
Chapter 2
</h1>
You manage to unlock the door and the moment you think that it's over, you are in a world of shock as you see that you are yet in another room with so many doors and not outside. You cannot open these doors and start waiting. A few seconds later, you get surprised as you see your old friends (which made up your crew whose names were: Derick, Niaomi and the leader Sean) coming out of the doors and you reunite with them. You then have flashbacks of what happened at the beginning and remember that you have to find the killer. After a while, a voice comes out of the intercoms and the guy (the same guy whose brother died) starts to congratulate everyone for making it and report that the others who did not make it out are dead, he continues on to say that a certain friend of his will wake up and kill everyone in the room for revenge but if you manage to survive then you can live for a while. Sean starts to question the man but there is no reply and then the guy cuts him off. Afterwards, a bloodied animatronic barges in the room and begins to run after everyone. Derick finds a high enough place to hide as everybody runs away from the animatronics. Everybody else tries to hit the animatronic since they outnumber it but their attacks are not doing any damage. The animatronic grabs Sean's head because he was in front of it and squeezes his head until it explodes, killing Sean. You and Niaomi manage to hide somewhere safely while the animatronic is busy with Sean and both of you think of a plan.
