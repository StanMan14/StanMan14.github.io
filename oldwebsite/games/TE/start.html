The moment you wake up, you notice that you can't move and realize that you are tied down to a steel table and start panicking. As you are trying to get out, a screen switches on showing a censored recorded video of a man. The mysterious man tells you that he wants to punish everyone who is and was in that crew for what a someone in that crew did to his younger brother and he shows you a picture of the person. As you see the person, you turn out rather confused because you are clearly positive that you have never seen him. The man continues on to say that the bomb which was placed inside you will deactivate if you manage to find the person who did it. Afterwards, as the screen switches off the machine that held you down loosens up and you begin panicking trying to think of a way you can get out. You look around and see some useful tools that may help you. You see:
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:Circle"> 
<p>
Revolver
</p> 
<p> 
<a href onclick="alert('Some numbers have to be clicked more than once to get the right letter.');">
A paper that has writing with a hint on it. 
</a>
</p>
<p> 
<a href onclick="alert('1=nothing 2=abc 3=def 4=ghi 5=jkl 6=mno 7=pqrs 8=tuv 9=wxyz');">
A paper that has another hint. 
</a>
</p>
</ul> 
<br>
You take the things and come to a door which says,"Enter a 13 digit number as a translation of 'escape' in numbers. If you enter the wrong number then the armed bomb inside your body will explode immediately."
