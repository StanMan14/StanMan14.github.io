<h1>
Chapter 3
</h1>
You cut the wire to the battery and the animatronic switches off. Derick gets back down and you and Niaomi start shouting at him for not helping. The argument then gets cut off by the door automatically opening and everybody gets in. The crew sees one of the members of their gang hanging upside down, below him is a turbine machine and ahead of him is a door to another room. The intercom starts again and tells everyone that the moment the intercom cuts off the turbine will turn on and the person hanging will be pulled in unless you get a brake hidden somewhere in his body. The guy also continues on to say that the room is full of mines so be careful where you step or everybody dies. The moment the intercom switches off the turbine starts and the guy being hanged cries for help, he tells you that the clue is a 4 digit number on the paper you have(take away all the odd numbers and follow the directions the remaining numbers from the password you entered in your room at the beginning).
